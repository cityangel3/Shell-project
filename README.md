# Shell-project
< In this project, I build project about concepts of system-level process contrl, process signalling, interprocess communication and running processes and jobs in the background in Linux shell that supports all the aforementioned functionalities in ther won programmed shell>                                                       
-> Phase1                                                                             
shell executes the basic internal shell commands such as cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, touch, cat, ..etc                        
-> Phase2                                                                           
In this code, you can running simple commands such as "ls -al | grep filename". you can have multiple chains of pipes as your command line argument.                                                      
-> Phase3                                                                                       
At last, in this shell program, you can run processes in background. It support the notion of job control, which allows users to move jobs back and forth between background and foreground, and to change the process state (running, stopped, or terminated) of the processes in a job.
